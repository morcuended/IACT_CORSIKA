 Telescope output file: 'iact_2.dat'

 Number of simulated telescopes: 4
 All telescopes are raised by 7.50 m
    Telescope 1 at x=  0.00 m, y=-84.85 m, z=  7.50 m with r=7.50 m
    Telescope 2 at x= 84.85 m, y=  0.00 m, z=  7.50 m with r=7.50 m
    Telescope 3 at x=  0.00 m, y= 84.85 m, z=  7.50 m with r=7.50 m
    Telescope 4 at x=-84.85 m, y=  0.00 m, z=  7.50 m with r=7.50 m

 Number of telescope arrays simulated: 1
 Array centers are at random offsets within  0.00 m radius from core.
 Impact position correction for bending of primary particle track in geomagnetic field is on.
 Up to 100000 bunches are kept in memory before writing to temporary files.
 When more than 5000000 bunches are collected per telescope, thinning sets in.
 All photon data is enclosed in one block per array.


 CORSIKA was compiled with the VOLUMEDET option and the IACT option
 automatically adapts to that. This means that all random shower core
 offsets are counted in a plane perpendicular to the shower axis.
 For non-vertical showers, the horizontal offsets can therefore be
 larger than specified in your CORSIKA inputs.

 CORSIKA was compiled without the SLANT option and all longitudinal
 distributions are in vertical depth units (the classical way).

 Start with event 1 (E=1.000 TeV, first interaction in 30.1 km height)
 Azimuth=  0.00 deg (S->E) which is 180.00 deg (N->E), zenith angle= 0.00 deg
 Observation level is at an altitude of 2200 m.
 4 telescopes are simulated in 1 array.
 Event header of event 1 written to output file.
