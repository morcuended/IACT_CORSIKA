# Inspection of IACT output for air fluorescence photon bunches simulated with CORSIKA

  - [IACT/ATMO package](https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/~bernlohr/iact-atmo/) version 1.50 by Konrad Bernlohr.

Here I show an example of photon bunches (red for fluorescence and blue for Cherenov) projected on the ground. IACT option of CORSIKA has been used to store those bunches.
